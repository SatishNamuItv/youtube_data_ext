Here is the approach we recommend you to take this course.

Go through the consolidated exercises and see if you are able to solve the problems or not.

Make sure to follow the order we have defined as part of the course.

After each and every section or module, make sure to solve the exercises. We have provided enough information to validate the output of your queries.

After the completion of the course try to solve the exercises using consolidated list.

Keep in mind that you will be reviewing the same exercises before the course, during the course as well as at the end of the course.

By the end of the course, if you are able to solve the problems, then you can come to a conclusion that you are able to master the core programming using one of the most popular programming language called as Python.
